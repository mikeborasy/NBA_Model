# NBA Game Outcome Prediction

## Introduction  
Sports analytics is a rapidly growing industry, especially with the rise of sports betting. In 2018, the U.S. gross gaming revenue was around $400 million, and by 2023, this figure skyrocketed to over $11 billion, primarily due to the legalization of sports betting in individual states.  
North Carolina legalized sports betting in March 2024, generating over $60 million in tax revenue within the first six months.

### Project Goal  
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for determining the outcome of NBA games. Achieving a prediction success rate above 50% would demonstrate the modelâ€™s practical value for sports betting markets and potentially for team strategy optimization.

## Data Source  
The primary dataset used in this project is the NBA Database from Kaggle, containing game outcomes and detailed statistics from 1947 to 2023.

After reviewing the available tables, the key datasets used for model building were `game.csv` and `team.csv`.

## Data Preprocessing  
Steps taken during data preprocessing include:  
- Handling incomplete data and NaN values  
- Dropping unnecessary columns  
- Converting data types for compatibility  
- Creating new features such as rolling averages to enhance prediction accuracy  
- Merging relevant columns from different datasets

## Modeling Approach  
The project uses various machine learning models and feature selection techniques, including:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)  
- Standardization and normalization techniques (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, etc.)
