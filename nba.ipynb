    "An area that has especially seen a lot of growth in recent years is sports betting. In 2018, the gross gaming revenue in the United States was around 400 million dollars, and by 2023, this revenue grew to over 11 billion dollars. This surge is largely attributed to the legalization of sports betting in individual U.S. states, including North Carolina. \n",

    "In March 2024, North Carolina legalized sports betting and has reportedly topped 60 million dollars in sports betting tax revenue over the first six months, with over 8.5 million dollars generated in taxes.

    "<font size=\"4\">I built a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes (winner) of NBA regular season games. I used the game.csv, line_scores.csv, and team.csv tables in an NBA database that recorded game/player stats and information across all seasons from 1947 to 2023. At first, I ran my model on features such as percentages (free throws, 3 point, field goal) and team stats (rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, etc) The dataset contained these stats for every NBA regular season game between 1947 and 2023. I then ran the logistic regression model (500 iterations) and tested the accuracy of the results compared to a test set, which was around 99%. I also modified the model to incorporate Recursive Feature Elimination, which helps select the most valuable features, and the accuracy jumped to 100%. Realizing that these accuracies were too high, I found that some columns such as field goals made, win percentage, and total points were effectively giving away the winner of the game. So after dropping columns with very high correlations with the game_winner column, the accuracies changed to 93.5% and 91.5%. \n",
    "\n",
    "After seeing the high accuracy rates from the model, I wanted to run predictions on future NBA games. However, during data preparation for the games I wanted to predict, I realized that it was impossible to fill the values for columns such as total rebounds, total assists, field goal percentage, etc., since these games had not been played yet. Therefore, I had to create rolling averages for these game stats, based on the previous 10 games. I then used a dataset that contained rolling averages instead of the actual stats for each individual game. When rerunning the logistic regression model and the logistic regression model with RFE, the accuracy dropped significantly to 64% and 61%. Still, in terms of an expected range of accuracy for predicting the outcomes of games, 60-65% is still relatively good. \n",
    "\n",
    "I ran the model on the games_to_predict, and the model predicted 60% (3/5) games. \n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, an accuracy of 60% is a good rate of success for predicting the winner of NBA games. However, we must keep in mind that this is a very small sample size, and that we cannot conclude that the model will maitain a 60% hit rate in a much larger number of game predictions. \n",

    "I used game percentages (field goal, 3 point, free throws) and game stats like rebounds, assists, and steals as my features for this model, however there are many other columns/data that I believe can increase the accuracy. For instance, I did not use any individual player stats and player injuries, which are present in the play_by_play, inactive_players, and player datasets. Between seasons as well as in the middle of a season, team rosters are always changing, which plays a very large factor in team performance game in and game out. Players also can get injured, and often do not play all 82 games in a season. For example, if Lebron James was not playing in a specific game, this would significantly affect the probability of the Lakers winning or losing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I used a dataset of all games from 1947-2023. I would assume that stats from more recent seasons are more effective for predicting future games than say the game stats from the 1947-1948 season. I also did not have the game stats from the previous 2023-2024 season, nor the stats from the games already played during the current 2024-2025 season. I believe these stats would be very beneficial for predicting future NBA games. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, when running my model on the set of 5 games on November 30th, it was able to produce a 60% success rate, but because of the small sample size, I cannot safely assume that this 60% will remain when a large number of games are added to predict. </font>\n"
